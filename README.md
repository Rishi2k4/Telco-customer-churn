# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Streamlit web app for predicting telecom customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using a deep learning approach. An ANN model is trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset and deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input customer details and receive real-time churn predictions along with the probability.
